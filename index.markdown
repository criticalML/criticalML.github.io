**Critical Machine Learning Studies**

The Critical Machine Learning Studies working group is a collection of researchers across the University of California system.

This working group aims to articulate, from within the humanities, a technically specific
and situated paradigm for engaging machine learning. Academic work on artificial intelligence
seems now to be omnipresent, precisely because AI itself is such a rapidly developing field of
research with widespread practical implementations lagging only slightly behind. The focus of
many of these academic initiatives is genealogical, philosophical, and political. While we by no
means eschew such perspectives, what we hope to contribute is a framework that yokes the
theoretical and the practical by focusing on specific machine learning architectures, rather than
understanding artificial intelligence as a technically and ideologically homogeneous cultural
technique. We aim to leverage, in a collaborative and interdisciplinary way, the combined
experience of UC faculty to design new approaches to describe, and critique in detail,
contemporary machine learning systems, focusing on their individual (“ML studies”), rather
than collective (“AI Studies”), properties, and their architecture-specific, rather than
model-specific, biases and shortcomings.

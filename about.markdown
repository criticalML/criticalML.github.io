The Critical Machine Learning Studies Working Group is composed of humanities researchers across the University of California system,
funded through the University of California Humanities Research Initiative.

Our collective areas of expertise and interest include digital humanities, STS, history of science, law, digital media theory, computer vision,
and more.

An upcoming project is an addition and intervention to the theorization of adversariality in machine learning systems.
